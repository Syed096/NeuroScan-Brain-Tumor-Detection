Model Training Preferences
------------------------------------------------

1. Data Augmentation:
If the data augmentation folder exists, the model will be trained using the augmented data.

2. Data Preprocessing:
If no data augmentation folder exists but a data preprocessing folder is present, the model will be trained using the preprocessed data.

3. Default Dataset:
If neither data augmentation nor preprocessing folders exist, the model will be trained using the dataset in the main directory (Yes/No folders).

Post-Model Training
After model training:
------------------------------------------------

1. Two Critical Folders:
Two essential folders are created: 'Model' and 'Model Evaluation'.

2. Model Evaluation:
The 'Model Evaluation' folder contains a crucial CSV file evaluating model performance. Do not delete this file.

3. Model Directory:
The 'Model' directory is vital for predictions. Do not delete it.

Deletion Guidelines

- Augmented data and preprocessing directories can be deleted after model training.
- Do not delete the 'model' and 'model_evaluation' folders, as they are essential for predictions.

Model Performance Optimization
------------------------------------------------
Key Factors Influencing Accuracy, Recall, and F1 Score:
1. Data Preprocessing Techniques:
    - Noise Reduction
    - Skull Stripping
2. Data Augmentation Techniques:
    1. Rotation
    2. Scaling
    3. Noise Injection

Impact on Model Performance:
- Data preprocessing techniques significantly affect model accuracy, recall, and F1 score.
- Data augmentation strategies enhance model robustness and generalizability.

Data Preprocessing Techniques:
- Noise Reduction: Improves data quality by removing unwanted signals.
- Skull Stripping: Enhances image contrast and reduces unnecessary features.

Data Augmentation Techniques:
- Rotation: Increases diversity by simulating various orientations.
- Scaling: Improves robustness against size variations.
- Noise Injection: Enhances model resilience to noisy data.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Experiment with different preprocessing and augmentation combinations.
2. Evaluate model performance using cross-validation.
3. Fine-tune techniques to achieve optimal accuracy, recall, and F1 score.
